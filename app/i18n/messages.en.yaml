login_manual:
  description: >
    On this page you can do authorization in manual mode, without the convenience of the SEP-07 magic.
    For this, you will need a simple Soviet secret key from your account. And even more precisely — a legitimate signature
    of a transaction from your account. Even for users of multisig.
  instruction: >
    Below in the field, enter the Stellar address, click «Get transaction». Take this transaction, and, for example,
    in the Stellar laboratory, add the necessary signatures. After that, insert the result in the field below, and click 
    «Authorize».

    invalid_signed_xdr: Error in the field of the signed transaction. There should be some kind of abracadabra, usually starting with AAAA...=
    wrong_account_id: The account in the transaction does not match the specified account
    wrong_seq_number: The transaction has expired, because a new transaction has been sent from this account
    bad_signature: Problem with the signature. Maybe there are not enough votes, or the wrong key was signed.
